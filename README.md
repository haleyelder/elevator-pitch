# Mad Libs Style Elevator Pitch Mini-Program

To practice my newly learned JavaScript skills and prior to the Code Oregon job fair early in December 2015, I made a Mad Libs style questionnaire "mini-program" to help asses how to set up your elevator pitch. As an ongoing project, the next steps to take would enhance the flow of the sentence to work with a larger scale of entries by the user.
